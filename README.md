### Method 
Class method and getter syntax is the same as it is for objects except you can not include commas between methods.

```
class Dog {
  constructor(name) {
    this._name = name;
    this._behavior = 0;
  }
 
  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }
 
  get behavior() {
    return this._behavior;
  }
 
  incrementBehavior() {
    this._behavior++;
  }
}
```
